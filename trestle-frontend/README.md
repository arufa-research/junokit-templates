# Overview

This app maintains a counter which is incremented everytime a user clicks the 'Increase Count' button.

## Connecting to Keplr

In order to use the app you need to connect your Keplr Wallet to the app. In this case follow these steps:

1. Most of the time, the app automatically sends a connection request to Keplr. If it doesn't, just click on the 'Connect Wallet' button.
2. A Keplr window will open up if you are running the app in a new browser session. The user should enter their Keplr password and authenticate themselves.
3. If the user is making the connection for the first time on his browser, another Keplr window asks the user to verify the connection if he /she trusts the network.
4. After verifying, the connection will be made in few seconds and the user should see 'Increment Count' button in place of 'Connect Wallet' button.

## Incrementing Counter

Incrementing the counter is as simple as it sounds. The user needs to follow these steps:

1. Click on the 'Increment Count' button. Make sure you have at least 0.6-1 JUNO tokens in your account for the gas fees.
2. A Keplr window will appear asking you to Approve the transaction and choose the fees among 'Low', 'Average', and 'High'.
3. Chose the appropriate fee and click 'Approve' button to complete the transaction.
4. After few seconds the counter will automatically update to the new value.
